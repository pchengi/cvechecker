# Change list

## v1.17.8

- Allow to pin CVES using a 'pinned_cves' file, with one CVE per entry; pinned CVEs cannot be muted, and if already muted, will be unmuted on next update.
- Allow interactive whitelisting (-w) option along with --cve.
- Allow muting with -l option to override previously muted entry, but not batch muting. This is to allow changing of reason for muting, product name etc. 

## v1.17.7

- Ignore CVEs older than what has been subscribed to in nvdchannels.conf, from both cvemap.xml and CVE-Modified.json.
- Added --eject-unsubscribed option to eject from existing vulnstore, entries which are not actually subscribed to.

## v1.17.5 

- Change from simplejson to json

## v1.17.4

- Add support to interactively mark CVEs for subsequent manual muting; this generates an output file called whitelist_out which can be used for muting. 

## v1.17.3

- Muting history for CVEs is not clobbered if they are already muted, thereby preserving the date they were first muted on,
and also the original comments (if any).

## v1.17.2

- Added Redhat AffectedPackage information for package match and exclude, to improve detection rate.

## v1.17.1

- Adopted semantic versioning.
- Added functionality to export and import muted entries; this eliminates the need to share the entire vulnerability store.
- A muted entry export can be made as part of a systematic backup.
- If upgrading from older versions (database not freshly initialized), first execute this:
````
python3 addmutingreason.py
````
