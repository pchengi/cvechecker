# Change list

## Untagged changes

- Modify keyword search logic to also look for a comma immediately following a search expression. Earlier, the match was looking for a space compulsorily. Now, it matches both a space, and a comma.

Info from NVD on CVE-2018-15756
-------------------------------
Spring Framework, version 5.1, versions 5.0.x prior to 5.0.10, versions 4.3.x prior to 4.3.20, and older unsupported versions on the 4.2.x branch provide support for range requests when serving static resources through the ResourceHttpRequestHandler, or starting in 5.0 when an annotated controller returns an org.springframework.core.io.Resource. A malicious user (or attacker) can add a range header with a high number of ranges, or with wide ranges that overlap,

## v1.17.9

- Allow to unmute all muted entries, by allowing use of --disp-mute and --mute flags together.
- Check for pinned_mute file entries only for mute, import, and update operations, and not unmute.

## v1.17.8

- Allow to pin CVES using a 'pinned_cves' file, with one CVE per entry; pinned CVEs cannot be muted, and if already muted, will be unmuted on next update.
- Allow interactive whitelisting (-w) option along with --cve.
- Allow muting with -l option to override previously muted entry, but not batch muting. This is to allow changing of reason for muting, product name etc. 

## v1.17.7

- Ignore CVEs older than what has been subscribed to in nvdchannels.conf, from both cvemap.xml and CVE-Modified.json.
- Added --eject-unsubscribed option to eject from existing vulnstore, entries which are not actually subscribed to.

## v1.17.5 

- Change from simplejson to json

## v1.17.4

- Add support to interactively mark CVEs for subsequent manual muting; this generates an output file called whitelist_out which can be used for muting. 

## v1.17.3

- Muting history for CVEs is not clobbered if they are already muted, thereby preserving the date they were first muted on,
and also the original comments (if any).

## v1.17.2

- Added Redhat AffectedPackage information for package match and exclude, to improve detection rate.

## v1.17.1

- Adopted semantic versioning.
- Added functionality to export and import muted entries; this eliminates the need to share the entire vulnerability store.
- A muted entry export can be made as part of a systematic backup.
- If upgrading from older versions (database not freshly initialized), first execute this:
````
python3 addmutingreason.py
````
