# Change list

## v1.17.3

- Muting history for CVEs is not clobbered if they are already muted, thereby preserving the date they were first muted on,
and also the original comments (if any).

## v1.17.2

- Added Redhat AffectedPackage information for package match and exclude, to improve detection rate.

## v1.17.1

- Adopted semantic versioning.
- Added functionality to export and import muted entries; this eliminates the need to share the entire vulnerability store.
- A muted entry export can be made as part of a systematic backup.
- If upgrading from older versions (database not freshly initialized), first execute this:
````
python3 addmutingreason.py
````
