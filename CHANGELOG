# Change list

## v1.17.21

- Fix for bug 6 (clobbering of muting information in exportedmutes due to dict initialization prior to loop)

## v1.17.20

- Minor changes to ordering of information in the 'Changelog' section of a report, to ensure full list of changes is immediately visible, without having to scroll.
- Sort exportedmutes by CVE name, prior to exporting. This makes it easier to diff on the file, before and after exporting.

## v1.17.19

- Add the --last option, to allow for an operation like the --after-date, but by specifying a number of days. This is useful when run from a cron. This also helps to guard against a deluge of alerts if a new product is added to the watch list.

## v1.17.18

- Change status from 'Seen' to 'R-Update' or 'S-Update', only if the ignore options are not set. If the ignore options are set, the CVE will neither be unmuted, nor will the status change.

## v1.17.17

- Fix for bug # 5.
- Enhanced information in reports, and changelog printed if changes were found, even if status was 'Fresh'.

## v1.17.16

- Fixed issue with unnecessary appending of history items, even if there were no real changes, leading to history bloat.

## v1.17.15

- Add --refresh-mutes option, to refresh the muting timestamp, without modifying other muting information.

## v1.17.14

- make updates atomic across multiple files, so order does not matter anymore; only change status to update if last update is seen, so fresh remains unchanged.
- will not see S-Updates and R-Updates anymore, if ignore has been configured.
- Mention changes pertaining to Redhat info in Changelog in print_result
- Update add_additional_db_fields.py

## v1.17.13

- Add option to ignore S-Update and R-Update (they won't unmute muted entries, if used).
- Add runtests.sh to run some minimal tests of functionalities (to be run after firstrun.sh on a new installation). 

## v1.17.12

- Bug fix for typo introduced in previous commit

## v1.17.11

- apply case-insensitive product and exclude matching logic, even while reading in from configuration file
- Mark updates as 'S-Update' if the only update is a score assignment/score change.

## v1.17.10

- Case-insensitive product and exclude matches, to avoid missing out hits on products with capitalized or non-lower case characters.

- Modify keyword search logic to also look for a comma immediately following a search expression. Earlier, the match was looking for a space compulsorily. Now, it matches both a space, and a comma.

Info from NVD on CVE-2018-15756
-------------------------------
Spring Framework, version 5.1, versions 5.0.x prior to 5.0.10, versions 4.3.x prior to 4.3.20, and older unsupported versions on the 4.2.x branch provide support for range requests when serving static resources through the ResourceHttpRequestHandler, or starting in 5.0 when an annotated controller returns an org.springframework.core.io.Resource. A malicious user (or attacker) can add a range header with a high number of ranges, or with wide ranges that overlap,

## v1.17.9

- Allow to unmute all muted entries, by allowing use of --disp-mute and --mute flags together.
- Check for pinned_mute file entries only for mute, import, and update operations, and not unmute.

## v1.17.8

- Allow to pin CVES using a 'pinned_cves' file, with one CVE per entry; pinned CVEs cannot be muted, and if already muted, will be unmuted on next update.
- Allow interactive whitelisting (-w) option along with --cve.
- Allow muting with -l option to override previously muted entry, but not batch muting. This is to allow changing of reason for muting, product name etc. 

## v1.17.7

- Ignore CVEs older than what has been subscribed to in nvdchannels.conf, from both cvemap.xml and CVE-Modified.json.
- Added --eject-unsubscribed option to eject from existing vulnstore, entries which are not actually subscribed to.

## v1.17.5 

- Change from simplejson to json

## v1.17.4

- Add support to interactively mark CVEs for subsequent manual muting; this generates an output file called whitelist_out which can be used for muting. 

## v1.17.3

- Muting history for CVEs is not clobbered if they are already muted, thereby preserving the date they were first muted on,
and also the original comments (if any).

## v1.17.2

- Added Redhat AffectedPackage information for package match and exclude, to improve detection rate.

## v1.17.1

- Adopted semantic versioning.
- Added functionality to export and import muted entries; this eliminates the need to share the entire vulnerability store.
- A muted entry export can be made as part of a systematic backup.
- If upgrading from older versions (database not freshly initialized), first execute this:
````
python3 addmutingreason.py
````
