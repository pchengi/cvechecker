# Change list

## v1.17.1

- Adopted semantic versioning.
- Added functionality to export and import muted entries; this eliminates the need to share the entire vulnerability store.
- A muted entry export can be made as part of a systematic backup.
- If upgrading from older versions (database not freshly initialized), first execute this:
````
python3 addmutingreason.py
````
